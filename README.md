# QGIS installer packages from conda

This repository produces QGIS installers based on [conda packages](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/qgis).

Packages can be found on the [release](https://github.com/opengisch/qgis-conda-builder/releases) page.

Within the installer, you can choose a path on your system in which the packages will be installed. A new conda environment will be created at the target location.
